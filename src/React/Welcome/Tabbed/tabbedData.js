        text: '<p> Located in the heart of the Palms neighborhood in West Los Angeles, Ky’s Pies is a new local pizzeria serving fresh authentic food made with local and seasonal ingredients. It is our mission to provide you with the best tasting pizza this side of the 405! <p/> <p> We just opened in March of 2022. The restaurant interior is modern yet approachable, making it the perfect go-to spot for local students and families. Come on in and have a cold local draft beer and watch the game with one of our fresh house-made pizza and wings with our signature buffalo sauce! There is no better place to eat on the west side, so come on in and grab a slice…or two! </p>',
